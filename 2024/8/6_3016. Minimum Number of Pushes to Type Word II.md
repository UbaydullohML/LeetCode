Goal:
- Calculate a score based on the frequency of characters in a word, with higher frequencies contributing more to the score.

Code:

    class Solution:
        def minimumPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
            cnt = Counter(word)
            ans = 0
            for i, x in enumerate(sorted(cnt.values(), reverse=True)):
                ans += (i // 8 + 1) * x
            return ans

Explanation: 

sort the character frequencies in descending order, then apply a weight to each frequency based on its position, and sum these weighted values to get the final score.


Let's use the word "abracadabra" as an example:

    cnt = Counter(word)

a: 5
b: 2
r: 2
c: 1
d: 1

    for i, x in enumerate(sorted(cnt.values(), reverse=True)):
    
This loop iterates over the sorted list of frequency counts.
i is the index of the current item in the sorted list.
x is the value at that index, which corresponds to the frequency count of a character.****

enumerate() - enumerate: Iterates over the sorted frequencies with index.

sorted() - sorted(cnt.values(), reverse=True): Sorts the character frequencies in descending order.

[5, 2, 2, 1, 1]

Sort the counts in descending order:

    ans += (i // 8 + 1) * x

// floor division - (i // 8 + 1) * x: Applies a weight to each frequency based on its index and adds it to the total score.

For 5 (i=0): Weight = 1, Contribution = 1 * 5 = 5
For 2 (i=1): Weight = 1, Contribution = 1 * 2 = 2
For 2 (i=2): Weight = 1, Contribution = 1 * 2 = 2
For 1 (i=3): Weight = 1, Contribution = 1 * 1 = 1
For 1 (i=4): Weight = 1, Contribution = 1 * 1 = 1

Score: 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11
