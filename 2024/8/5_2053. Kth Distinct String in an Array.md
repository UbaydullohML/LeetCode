Goal:
- find kth distinct string in an array
  
Code:

    from collections import Counter
    class Solution:
        def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
            counts = Counter(arr)
            for i in arr:
                if counts[i] == 1:
                    k-=1
                    if k == 0:
                        return i
            return ""


Explanation how it works

A string is considered distinct if it appears exactly once in the array. The approach involves counting the occurrences of each string and then finding the kth string that appears exactly once.

    counts = Counter(arr)

Counter() - Counter(arr) creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are elements from arr and the values are the counts of each element.

counts = Counter([4, 5, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8, 9])
counts = {4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}

    for i in arr:
        if counts[i] == 1:
            k-=1
            
Iterate through the array:

The for loop goes through each element i in arr. if counts[i] == 1: checks if the element i appears exactly once in the array.
If it does, we decrement k by 1 (k -= 1).

Check for the k-th unique element:

If after decrementing, k is 0, it means we have found the k-th unique element. The function returns this element i.

Visual Representaiton:

    arr: [4, 5, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8, 9]
    counts: {4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
    k: 2
    
    Iteration:
    1. i = 4, counts[4] = 2, k = 2 (not unique, continue)
    2. i = 5, counts[5] = 2, k = 2 (not unique, continue)
    3. i = 6, counts[6] = 1, k = 1 (unique, decrement k)
    4. i = 4, counts[4] = 2, k = 1 (not unique, continue)
    5. i = 7, counts[7] = 1, k = 0 (unique, decrement k)
    
    Output: 7
